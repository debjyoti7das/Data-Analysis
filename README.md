This data analysis project provides a detailed examination of automobile inventory data, focusing on trends in vehicle availability across years and fuel types. Using SQL queries, the analysis addresses key questions posed by managers and clients, such as the count of cars available in specific years, fuel-type distribution by year, and the identification of years with high inventory volumes. Additional analyses include a complete overview of car records from 2015 to 2023 and year-wise counts of diesel, petrol, and CNG vehicles. The insights aim to support data-driven decision-making for inventory management and client inquiries.
